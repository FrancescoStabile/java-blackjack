# java-blackjack
This project is a simple Command Line Interface implementation of the classic "Blackjack" using Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles.
Developing this project I've been able to apply and enhance my knowledge through:

- Object-Oriented Approach: Throughout the development of this project, I learned and applied essential Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The project is structured using classes, objects, and inheritance to ensure a clean and modular design.

- Class Hierarchy: The project includes several classes, such as "Card," "Deck," "Hand," "Person," "Player," and "Dealer," which are organized into a hierarchy to represent different elements of the game.

- Game Logic: The core logic of the Blackjack game is implemented using Java methods and control structures, the game handles player decisions to "Hit" or "Stand," calculates hand values, and determines the winner.

- Shuffling and Randomization: To simulate the randomness of card distribution, the project implements a custom shuffling mechanism within the "Deck" class, when a new round starts, the deck is initially populated with a complete set of cards representing all ranks and suits. Instead of relying on an external library, the project uses a custom "mix()" method inside the "Deck" class to shuffle the cards in a pseudo-random order.
- 
- Exception Handling: The project incorporates exception handling to ensure smooth user interaction, preventing the application from crashing due to invalid inputs from the user.
